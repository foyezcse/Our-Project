                       The goal of this system is to provide the information of the doctors and hospitals that provide service to
                       the autistic children. Imagine that you are a parent of an autistic children and your child is having a conversion
                       (brain issue and neuro disorder) and you are taking your child to different hospitals and they are rejecting
                       to admit him/her. Moreover, your child is having medical issues and you need to take him/her
                       to a doctor but you don’t know which doctor provides service to the autistic children. At times like these,
                       how can you ask for help? Just give a visit to our app and you will get all the doctors’ information according
                       to their specialty who provide service to the autistic children. Moreover, you also can get the information about
                       the hospitals that provide service to the autistic children. Our system is divided into two parts, the client side
                       and the server side. The client side & the server side both are developed by using Java Web. It can be run on any
                       device that has an internet connection and a browser installed.
                       Autism Help is a project that provides a helping hand to the parents and the guardians of the autistic
                       children. Now a days,
                       number of the autistic children has increased drastically. Thus the
                       guardians are facing problems and difficulties to get a doctor when in need.
                       They newly parents are not experienced enough about autism and get confused when they need to

                       visit a doctor or a hospital.

                       Autism Help allows the users to the information about both the doctors and the
                       hospital that provides service to the autistic children. They don’t need to get panic
                       and just to open this project and search about their nearby doctors and hospitals. Thus
                       Autism Help provides information about area based hospitals and about category based doctors.
                       By using Autism Help users can easily find the hospitals that provide services to the autistic children. They can also find the doctors on the basis of the divisions of diseases.
